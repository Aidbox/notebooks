Restrict access from those who no longer use certain applications or services.

Implicit flow - everything happens in the browser, on the front channel. Common in single page applications (SPAs).

Authorization Code flow - the front channel is used to get an authorization code. The back channel is used by the client application to exchange the authorization code for an access token (and optionally a refresh token). This is the gold standard of OAuth flows.

Client Credentials flow - often used for server-to-server and service account scenarios. It's a back channel only flow to obtain an access token using the client's credentials. It differs from most of the other flows in that there is no user involved.

Resource Owner Password flow - a legacy flow that allows you to pass a username and password to the authorization server. Only recommended when you have old-school clients to accommodate.
